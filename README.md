It includes graph visualizations to represent the strength of passwords, allowing users to easily assess their password security.

Key Features:

Real-time password strength analysis: Evaluates passwords based on length, complexity (uppercase, lowercase, numeric, special characters), and common patterns.
Graphical feedback: Visual representation of password strength through interactive graphs.
Reactive UI: Instant updates as the user types, providing immediate strength suggestions.
Strong password suggestions: Offers actionable suggestions for creating more secure passwords, such as adding more characters, varying character types, and avoiding common patterns.
